# Touch-N-Go-Soccer-Trainer-Reports-Public-




Note: Project data is proprietary and cannot be shared publicly. To address this, I have created this public repository containing project details, and a separate private repository with the full report files and documents. I can provide access to the private repository upon request, or present the methodology and visualizations in detail.
