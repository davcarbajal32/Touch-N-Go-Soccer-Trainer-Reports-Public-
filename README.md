# TouchNGo Perfromance and Class SignUp Analysis PUBLIC
IMPORTANT NOTE: Project data is proprietary and cannot be shared publicly. To address this, I have created this public repository containing project details, and a separate private repository with the full report files and documents. I can provide access to the private repository upon request, or present the methodology and visualizations in detail.

Project Description:\n
At Touch N Go Soccer, I developed a reporting tool in Python to evaluate trainer performance and class participation. Using enrollment data, I built visualizations in Matplotlib to show both percentage of capacity filled and raw sign-up counts over time. These reports gave management a clear view of which classes were thriving or underperforming, helping them make data-driven decisions about trainer assignments and scheduling.

Python Libraries used:
â€“ Matplotlib: Created bar charts comparing enrollment trends by percentage and total sign-ups

Conclusions:
The visualized reports allowed management to quickly identify participation trends, optimize trainer assignments, and improve program scheduling. This project demonstrated how simple but well-structured Python visualizations can provide actionable business insights.
